Which means I will head to another country for work, maybe start new life with my newly wedded wife\nin a country that not totally suck (I’m from China by the way). Dramatic life change makes you want to record what you\ndo and what you think during. It’s a precious experience, it would be a waste to not write anything about it.\nMaybe this can help someone as well.</p>\n<h2>Share My Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Another reason I want to start a blog, is that I want to share my software engineer experience with the world. I have\nbeen participating in recruiting for almost a year now, and most of times I’m really not satisfied with what I see.\nI would want to shake my candidate up and tell them the ‘good’ way to treat work and think software things. I can’t\nimagine why there are so many (I mean 8 out of 10) so called engineers in China can’t even write and understand\na quick-sort, and still bragging about their work or their leading experience. </p>\n<p>It’s not that quick-sort is very important for work or something, you can still write a decent web page if you don’t know\nmuch about quick-sort. I’m trying to express a feeling of disappointment as an first-round interviewer who found out\ntheir candidate got to be leader while lacking basic knowledge of software engineering all the time. I don’t know,\nmaybe from someone else’s perspective, I’m the one lacking basic knowledge.</p>\n<p>Still, with my two years of experience (one leading a small team), there is something about software developing I think\nI could share with the world.</p>\n<h2>Practice Technical Writing</h2>\n<p>English is not my native language, but I will start my new work in Singapore. To better express my idea in workplace, I\nhave to have my speaking and writing skill horned. Sometimes expressing your idea is the first step of creating influence,\nright?</p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n<p>From 2016 to yesterday, I worked in <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/">Zhihu.com</a>. And I fortunately have worked with some great\nengineers. <a href="https://github.com/ambar">Ambar</a> is the coolest person I know, kind but severe. He won’t tolerant any\ninefficiency when it comes to develop workflow, but super kind to others when others seek him for help.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Hello World",date:"June 23, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hello-world/",previous:null,next:{fields:{slug:"/translate-Dijkstra-parable/"},frontmatter:{title:"翻译：Dijkstra's parable"}}}}}});
