&lt;h2&gt;A Dramatic Life Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first reason I made this decision is that I got a new job at &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopee.sg/&quot;&gt;Shopee&lt;/a&gt;, a south-east Asia
e-commerce company. Which means I will head to another country for work, maybe start new life with my newly wedded wife
in a country that not totally suck (I’m from China by the way). Dramatic life change makes you want to record what you
do and what you think during. It’s a precious experience, it would be a waste to not write anything about it.
Maybe this can help someone as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share My Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I want to start a blog, is that I want to share my software engineer experience with the world. I have
been participating in recruiting for almost a year now, and most of times I’m really not satisfied with what I see.
I would want to shake my candidate up and tell them the ‘good’ way to treat work and think software things. I can’t
imagine why there are so many (I mean 8 out of 10) so called engineers in China can’t even write and understand
a quick-sort, and still bragging about their work or their leading experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that quick-sort is very important for work or something, you can still write a decent web page if you don’t know
much about quick-sort. I’m trying to express a feeling of disappointment as an first-round interviewer who found out
their candidate got to be leader while lacking basic knowledge of software engineering all the time. I don’t know,
maybe from someone else’s perspective, I’m the one lacking basic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with my two years of experience (one leading a small team), there is something about software developing I think
I could share with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Technical Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English is not my native language, but I will start my new work in Singapore. To better express my idea in workplace, I
have to have my speaking and writing skill horned. Sometimes expressing your idea is the first step of creating influence,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2016 to yesterday, I worked in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zhihu.com/&quot;&gt;Zhihu.com&lt;/a&gt;. And I fortunately have worked with some great
engineers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ambar&quot;&gt;Ambar&lt;/a&gt; is the coolest person I know, kind but severe. He won’t tolerant any
inefficiency when it comes to develop workflow, but super kind to others when others seek him for help.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
